I decided to do the following bonus tasks:
-MVC architecture: I decided to try this bonus task because I felt it was important for Communix and so I can learn something new myself from this assignment
-Three or more distinct level: I wanted to show my knowledge of scriptable objects and how I can use it to implement multiple levels easily 
-Two Player game: I wanted to use my modular architecture to add two-player mode easily without many changes
